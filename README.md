# Netflix_Movies_Analysis
Netflix EDA: Revealing movie duration insights with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

This GitHub repository contains an exploratory data analysis project that investigates whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. Using the '**netflix_data.csv**' dataset, we explore the movie data, analyze trends, and answer the question of whether movie lengths have been declining. 
The analysis involves **data manipulation**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **data visualization** using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

**Key Project Tasks:**

- Load and preprocess the Netflix dataset.
- Filter out TV shows to focus on movies.
- Analyze movie durations, release years, and genres.
- Create visualizations to gain insights into the data.
- Conclude whether movies on Netflix are indeed getting shorter.

This project aims to provide a data-driven understanding of the trends in Netflix movie durations and offers insights into factors contributing to any observed changes. Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook ('**Netflix_Movie_Length_Analysis.ipynb**') for the complete analysis and results.

Let's delve into the world of Netflix movies and their evolving lengths!"
